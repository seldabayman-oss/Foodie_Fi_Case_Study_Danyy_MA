To answer these data analysis questions for the Foodie-Fi case study, we'll assume you have access to a SQL database with relevant tables. Here's how you can approach each question:

1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_customers
FROM customers;

2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset ? 
Use the start of the month as the group by value!

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', start_date) AS month_start, COUNT(*) AS trial_starts
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_name = 'trial'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', start_date)
ORDER BY month_start;

3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name

SELECT plan_name, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM subscriptions
WHERE start_date > '2020-12-31'
GROUP BY plan_name
ORDER BY count DESC;

4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?

WITH churned_customers AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS churned_count
    FROM subscriptions
    WHERE plan_name = 'churned'
),
total_customers AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_count
    FROM customers
)
SELECT 
    churned_count, 
    (churned_count::FLOAT / total_count * 100)::NUMERIC(5, 1) AS churned_percentage
FROM churned_customers, total_customers;

5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?

WITH initial_churn AS (
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM (
        SELECT customer_id, plan_name, 
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS rn
        FROM subscriptions
    ) sub
    WHERE rn = 1 AND plan_name = 'churned'
),
total_trials AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS trial_count
    FROM subscriptions
    WHERE plan_name = 'trial'
)
SELECT 
    COUNT(initial_churn.customer_id) AS churn_after_trial,
    (COUNT(initial_churn.customer_id)::FLOAT / total_trials.trial_count * 100)::INTEGER AS percentage_churned
FROM initial_churn, total_trials;

6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?

WITH initial_plan AS (
    SELECT customer_id, 
           MIN(start_date) AS initial_date
    FROM subscriptions
    GROUP BY customer_id
),
subsequent_plans AS (
    SELECT s.customer_id, s.plan_name, COUNT(*) AS plan_count
    FROM subscriptions s
    JOIN initial_plan i
    ON s.customer_id = i.customer_id AND s.start_date > i.initial_date
    GROUP BY s.customer_id, s.plan_name
)
SELECT plan_name, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count,
       (COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)::FLOAT / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM customers) * 100)::NUMERIC(5, 1) AS percentage
FROM subsequent_plans
GROUP BY plan_name;

7. What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31?

SELECT plan_name, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count,
       (COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)::FLOAT / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM customers) * 100)::NUMERIC(5, 1) AS percentage
FROM subscriptions
WHERE start_date <= '2020-12-31'
GROUP BY plan_name;
8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?

WITH annual_upgrades AS (
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM subscriptions
    WHERE plan_name = 'annual' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date) = 2020
)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS annual_upgrades_2020
FROM annual_upgrades;

9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to switch to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?

WITH customer_join_dates AS (
    SELECT customer_id, MIN(start_date) AS join_date
    FROM subscriptions
    GROUP BY customer_id
),
annual_plan_dates AS (
    SELECT customer_id, MIN(start_date) AS annual_date
    FROM subscriptions
    WHERE plan_name = 'annual'
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT AVG(annual_date - join_date) AS avg_days_to_annual
FROM customer_join_dates cj
JOIN annual_plan_dates ap
ON cj.customer_id = ap.customer_id;

10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30-day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days, etc.)?

WITH customer_join_dates AS (
    SELECT customer_id, MIN(start_date) AS join_date
    FROM subscriptions
    GROUP BY customer_id
),
annual_plan_dates AS (
    SELECT customer_id, MIN(start_date) AS annual_date
    FROM subscriptions
    WHERE plan_name = 'annual'
    GROUP BY customer_id
),
days_to_annual AS (
    SELECT cj.customer_id, (annual_date - join_date) AS days
    FROM customer_join_dates cj
    JOIN annual_plan_dates ap
    ON cj.customer_id = ap.customer_id
)
SELECT CASE 
           WHEN days BETWEEN 0 AND 30 THEN '0-30 days'
           WHEN days BETWEEN 31 AND 60 THEN '31-60 days'
           WHEN days BETWEEN 61 AND 90 THEN '61-90 days'
           ELSE '90+ days'
       END AS period,
       COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM days_to_annual
GROUP BY period;

11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?

WITH pro_to_basic AS (
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM subscriptions
    WHERE plan_name = 'basic' 
    AND start_date > (
        SELECT MAX(start_date) 
        FROM subscriptions 
        WHERE customer_id = subscriptions.customer_id 
        AND plan_name = 'pro'
    )
    AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date) = 2020
)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS downgrades_2020
FROM pro_to_basic;
